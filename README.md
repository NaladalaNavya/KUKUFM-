Perfect! Here's a list of **popular and cutting-edge AI models and approaches** used for **music generation**, depending on whether you want to generate **notes (MIDI)**, **raw audio**, or **symbolic music** like chords and melodies.

## üéµ Popular AI Models for Music Generation

### üîÅ **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
- **LSTM/GRU models**: Great for sequence data like music notes.
- Used in early music generation projects like **BachBot**.
- Can generate MIDI sequences from seed melodies.

> ‚úÖ Pros: Good at handling sequential data  
> ‚ùå Cons: Struggles with long-term dependencies

### üéº **Transformer Models**
#### 1. **Music Transformer** by Magenta
- A transformer-based model for music generation.
- Captures long-term structure in music better than RNNs.
- Generates polyphonic music (like multiple instruments together).
- Trained on MIDI data (e.g., Bach, Beethoven, etc.)

**Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04281](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04281)  
**Code**: [Magenta repo](https://github.com/magenta/magenta)

#### 2. **MuseNet** by OpenAI
- Generates 4-minute compositions with 10+ instruments.
- Can blend styles (e.g., Bach + The Beatles).
- Trained on MIDI data and uses a deep transformer architecture.

**Demo**: Was available on OpenAI‚Äôs site  
**Not open-source**, but inspired many projects.

---

#### 3. **MusicLM** by Google
- **Text-to-Music** model: You give a prompt like *‚Äúupbeat jazz with saxophone‚Äù* and it generates realistic music.
- Uses hierarchical modeling and audio embeddings.
- Capable of generating minutes of coherent music.

**Paper**: [MusicLM: Generating Music From Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11325)  
**Audio Samples**: Available in the paper's supplement.

---

#### 4. **Riffusion**
- Real-time music generation using **Stable Diffusion** on spectrograms.
- Trained on images of spectrograms (visual audio).
- Generates looping instrumental music from text prompts.

### üß† GANs for Music
#### 5. **MuseGAN**
- A Generative Adversarial Network for multi-track music generation.
- Can generate parts for different instruments simultaneously (bass, drums, etc.).

**Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06298](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06298)

### üßë‚Äçüé§ Symbolic AI Models
#### 6. **AIVA (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Artist)**
- AI composer for games, film scores, etc.
- Not open source, but notable for commercial use.

### üß© Other Tools & Libraries

| Tool         | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Magenta** (by Google) | TensorFlow-based toolkit for music and art generation |
| **Jukebox** (OpenAI)    | Generates **raw audio** (not just MIDI), trained on singing + instruments |
| **Amper Music**         | Commercial tool using AI to generate royalty-free music |
| **HydraSynth + AI**     | For real-time AI-generated synthesizer music |

## üõ†Ô∏è Want to Build One?

You can build your own music generation model using:
- **Dataset**: MAESTRO, Lakh MIDI, NES-MDB, or Groove MIDI Dataset
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Magenta
- **Interfaces**: Streamlit or Gradio to demo the generation live
